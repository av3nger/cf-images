== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this work? =

The plugin will use the Cloudflare Images service to host all supported images and serve them with the best possible settings to the user.

= Is this free? =

Yes, the plugin is 100% free. A Cloudflare account with activated Cloudflare Images option is required.
Cloudflare may charge a fee for the use of this feature, depending on the plan used.

= What are the supported image formats? =

You can upload the following image formats to Cloudflare Images:
* PNG
* GIF
* JPEG
* WebP

= Are there any other limitations? =

These are the maximum allowed sizes and dimensions Cloudflare Images supports:

* Images' height and width are limited to 10,000 pixels.
* Image metadata is limited to 1024 bytes.
* Images have a 10 megabyte (MB) size limit.
* Animated GIFs, including all frames, are limited to 100 megapixels (MP).

= Why are not all images being replaced in content? =

By default, the plugin relies on WordPress core functions to process images.
Some themes and plugins can implement their own image processing functions, which can prevent the plugin from replacing the image URLs in content. If you are experiencing this, try to enable the `Parse page for images` module in the plugin settings.
If something is still not working for you, please let me know by creating a support ticket on the plugin support forums.
